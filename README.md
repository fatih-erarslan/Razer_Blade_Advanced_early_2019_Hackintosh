# Razer Blade Advanced early 2019 macOS 10.14 Hackintosh

**Note: I'AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU MESS UP YOUR COMPUTER USING THIS GUIDE!**

Intro

![About this Mac](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/About_Mac.png)

I have been using Apple hardware and software since 1996 for macOS has been the best OS to meet my needs. My first computer was a PowerBook 150. Since then, I used mostly Apple mobile solutions: PowerBook G3, PowerBook Titanium, bunch of MacBook Pro 13" and 15".
But, I'm really dissatisfied with the latest MacBook Pro 2017 as it has a useless keyboard with arrow keys designed for Tinker Bell and zero ability to upgrade up to 32Gb RAM back then in 2017. Yes. I know. This is 100% Intel failure. Just like performance and thermal issues the Intel CPU had for the last 6 years. Intel just doesn’t care about the mobile CPU market anymore.

So, finally, I made a decision to go to the dark side and to switch to the hackintosh notebook. After doing some research, I selected Razer Blade Advanced. This has, perhaps, the best combo of design (!), performance and upgradability.

**Purpose**

* UNIX/Linux backend software development. C, Go, Python.
* ML development (requires CUDA and Nvidia GPU).
* Embedded software and hardware development (IoT).
* Cloud and DevOps.
* iOS and macOS development mostly for fun.
* Gaming maybe once per month. Usually 3A titles like
	* [Tomb Rider](https://tombraider.square-enix-games.com/en-gb)
	* [Deus Ex](https://square-enix-games.com/en_US/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided/)
	* [Tom Clancy's The Division 1/2](https://tomclancy-thedivision.ubisoft.com/game/en-us/home)
	* [Mass Effect](https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect)
	* [Pillars of Eternity](https://eternity.obsidian.net)
	* [Divinity: Original Sin](http://www.divinityoriginalsin.com), etc.

Hardware Upgrades and Tools
---

The bundled ``WiFI`` and ``NVMe`` is not compatible with macOS and should be replaced. Please find below the recommended replacement parts, already tested for compatibility. Usually I need to deploy for testing 4-5 node Kubernetes cluster with at least 4Gb per node. So 32GB is a necessary upgrade for me.

macOS have native support and works better with 4k blocks. Check **NVMe format**.
Performance tested with [Blackmagic Disk Speed Test](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550?mt=12). Samsung EVO 970 1Tb NVMe and Sabrent Rocket 1Tb NMVe have the same Read/Write performance. But Samsung EVO stays about 8-12° C hotter on heave load. Even with additional passive cooling.

**Note: I do recommend to use at least 1Tb NVMe for dual boot with Windows 10.**

Preparation

### BIOS update

It is very important to make all the updates for BIOS before starting any macOS deployment. ACPI sources will be different after BIOS update and this will require to dump ACPI sources and patch them again. And, that is not a pleasant task.

Download BIOS, EC, ME, etc. Firmware and apply them from stock Windows partition.

[Razer Hardware Drivers download URL](http://drivers.razersupport.com//index.php?_m=downloads&_a=view&parentcategoryid=864&pcid=860&nav=0,350,860)

* Boot into Windows.
* Open [Razer Hardware Drivers download URL](http://drivers.razersupport.com//index.php?_m=downloads&_a=view&parentcategoryid=864&pcid=860&nav=0,350,860) in preferred browser.
* Download the latest BIOS, EC, ME, etc. Firmware updates.
* Apply these updates in a required order. This is very important! Read documentation carefully.

**Useful information**

* [Razer Support Website](https://support.razer.com)


### BIOS unlock

Certain changes for the BIOS configuration should be done to make macOS bootable on the Razer Blade Advanced.

* Disable ``VT-d``. Apple stopped supporting this long time ago and will not boot in some cases with enabled ``VT-d``. Do not mistake ``VT-d`` for ``VMX`` or ``VTX``.
* Increase memory pre-allocated for ``DVMT``. Usually ``DVMT`` is pre-allocated for ``32Mb``. MacOS requires ``64Mb`` minimum.
* Deactivate ``CFG-Lock``. Required by macOS Power Management.
* Disable ``Secure Boot``.
* etc.

Some of these configurations can be fixed one or another way in ``Clover`` configuration file. But, it is better to play safe and change configuration in BIOS. Deactivation of the ``CFG-Lock`` can help a lot with power management.

If the BIOS is upgraded to the latest version and

| | Version |
| ---: | :--- |
| ``System BIOS`` | 1.05 |
| ``EC FW`` | 1.03 |
| ``MCU FW`` | 1.00.00.00 |

it's safely to use already modded dump from ``BIOS_mod/`` folder and jump to **BIOS flashing**.

Otherwise, follow the **BIOS export** step.


### BIOS export

* Boot into Windows.
* Download this repository.
* Open ``Tools\AMI\AfuWin64\`` folder.
* Run ``AFUWINGUIx64.EXE`` application.
* In ``AFUWINGUI`` application click ``Save`` button to export current BIOS.

![AFUWINGUI_Save](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/AFUWINGUI_Save.png)

* Save BIOS to ``Desktop`` folder.
* Close ``AFUWINGUI`` application.


### BIOS modding

Most of the options are required for further undervolting and overclocking. But, some of them are necessary for the macOS. These options are marked with **!**

* Open ``Tools\AMI\AMIBCP64\`` folder.
* Run ``AMIBCP64.exe`` application.
* In ``AMIBCP`` application click ``Open``, navigate to ``Desktop`` and open BIOS saved in previous steps.
* In ``AMIBCP`` application
	* Unfold root folder in the left pane. This folder is blank and have no name.

### WiFi and NVMe replacement

WiFi and NVMe replacement is easy enough for this Model. You just need to unscrew the bottom case. Check the video provided below for more information.

**Useful information**

* [How to Upgrade the Razer Blade 15 RAM & SSD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TZih3m0-Ys)
* [Razer Blade Advanced RTX 2070 SSD Replacement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-ZfDNdj2WU)
* [INVENTORY OF SUPPORTED/UNSUPPORTED WIRELESS CARDS #2, SIERRA -> CATALINA](https://osxlatitude.com/forums/topic/11138-inventory-of-supportedunsupported-wireless-cards-2-sierra-catalina/)


### (Optional) NVMe format with 4k block

This step is optional. MacOS works faster and better with NVMe with 4k blocks. Usually NVMe formatted with 512 or 512e block size for unknown reason. Maybe another Windows compatibility issue. Anyway, Windows 10 works with no issues with NVMe with 4k blocks.

The best way to format NVMe drive is to boot from Linux Live USB media and use ``smartctl`` and ``nvme-cli`` tools.

* Download [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) on Windows or macOS machine.
* Download [Ubuntu Desktop Live Image](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) on same Windows or macOS machine.
* Insert USB media with at least 16Gb. Drive will be formatted and all data will be erased.
* Run ``balenaEtcher``
* Select image ``Ubuntu Desktop Live Image`` downloaded before.

![balenaEtcher_Select_Image](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/balenaEtcher_Select_Image.png)

* Select USB media.

![balenaEtcher_Select_Media](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/balenaEtcher_Select_Media.png)

* And press ``Flash!``.

![balenaEtcher_Flash](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/balenaEtcher_Flash.png)

**Note: Ubuntu lacks the support by default drivers for most Broadcom WiFi modules.**

There are 2 way to overcome this issue:

* Use ``USB to Ethernet`` cable.
* Install proprietary WiFi drivers. Follow this instruction [WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx)

| Accessories | Description | Amazon URL |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |

* Verify your NVMe to be recognized and manage 4K blocs by typing this command in ``Terminal`` window

```
sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvme0
```

* and press ``Enter``

![Ubuntu_Run_smartctl](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/Ubuntu_Run_smartctl.png)

* You should have two lines under ``Supported LBA sizes`` one with data ``512B`` starting with ID ``0``
one with data ``4K`` starting with ID ``1``.

![Ubuntu_Run_smartctl_result](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/Ubuntu_Run_smartctl_result.png)

* If ``4K`` is absent, NVMe does not support 4k blocks. Reboot computer and follow **macOS install media preparation**.
* Usually NVMe formatted to ``512B``. And this ``512B`` will be marked with asterix ``*`` or ``+``.
* Format the NVME with ``4K`` blocs with the command

```
sudo nvme format -l 1 /dev/nvme0
```

* and press ``Enter`` and follow on-screen instructions.

![Ubuntu_Install_nvme_format](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/Ubuntu_Install_nvme_format.png)

* This command will erase all the information on the NVMe drive.
* To verify that the LBA 4K size is properly selected re-type the ``smartctl`` command

```
sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvme0
```

### (Optional) Liquid Metal re-paste

**Be very careful and do this at your OWN RISK!**

This step is not necessary and can be recommended only for hardcore gamers with experience of building their own rigs. Razer is already using very good thermal paste, so re-pasting thermal paste is not very useful until liquid metal is used. The ``Grizzly Conductonaut Thermal Grease Paste`` may be the best one. Read more about liquid metal thermal paste and all the issues it can cause before making the decision to proceed.

macOS
---

### macOS install media preparation

Use you own OR borrow some friend Mac computer.

* On macOS, download ``UniBeast`` OR ``TINU`` up to your preferences.
* Run ``UniBeast`` OR ``TINU`` application.
* Follow the instruction and build macOS installation media macOS 10.14 Mojave. It is very important to build media with the latest available version of Mojave.
* Copy this applications and the files to the USB installation media
	* ``Clover Configurator``
	* ``KextBeast``
	* ``MaciASL``
	* ``iasl``
	* This repository ZIP archive.

**Useful information**

* [UniBeast: Install macOS Mojave on Any Supported Intel-based PC](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/unibeast-install-macos-mojave-on-any-supported-intel-based-pc.259381/)
* [TINU](https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU)


### macOS installation

* Insert the macOS USB install media.
* Boot/Reboot computer.
* Press repeatedly ``F12`` until you ``Boot Menu`` will show.
* Select the macOS USB install media.
* Open ``Disk Utility`` from ``Tools`` menu.
* Format NVMe to ``APFS``.
* Follow usual macOS installation procedure.
* After reboot repeatedly tap ``F12`` again until get ``Boot Menu``.
* Select macOS USB install media again to boot in ``Clover``.
* In ``Clover``, select NVMe drive to continue installation.
* Repeat this procedure again when macOS reboots the computer.
* Follow the usual macOS installation procedure.
* You can use TimeMachine Backup restore procedure during macOS installation.

**Note: Do not try to connect the computer with iCloud before you generate proper SMBIOS! This step is explained in the 'iCloud. iMessages and FaceTime' step.**

**Useful information**

* [UniBeast: Install macOS Mojave on Any Supported Intel-based PC](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/unibeast-install-macos-mojave-on-any-supported-intel-based-pc.259381/)


### Install EFI and Extensions

Once the macOS installation is finished:

* Login with the user with admin privileges: usually, the first one created during the installation procedure.
* Run ``Clover Configurator`` application from the USB installation media.
* From ``Mount EFI`` on the left side mount NVMe EFI partition.
* Copy this repository ZIP archive file to ``~/Desktop/``.
* Unarchive this repository Zip archive file on ``~/Desktop/``.
* Copy the folder ``EFI`` from unpacked archive to previously mounted ``EFI`` partition.
* If you have different version of Razer Blade, please remove files listed below from ``EFI`` partition, otherwise this can cause kernel panic or other issues
	* ``EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/DSDT.aml``
	* ``EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/SSDT-12-OptTabl.aml``
	* ``EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/SSDT-USBX.aml``
* Copy all ``.kext`` files from the folder ``Extensions`` from previously unpacked archive to the ``~/Desktop/`` folder. Do not copy ``CPUFriendDataProvider.kext`` if you have different version of Razer Blade! 
* Run ``KextBeast.pkg`` application from the USB installation media.
* Click ``Continue`` and click ``Agree``.
* Select ``/Library/Extensions`` and click ``Continue``.
* Click ``Install``.
* If extensions are installed without any issues run ``Terminal`` application from the ``/Applications/Utilities`` folder.
* In ``Terminal`` application window type

```
sudo kextcache -i /
```

* and press ``Enter``.
* When command ``kextcache`` finish execution, unmount and detach the macOS USB installation media, and reboot computer to apply new configuration.
* Repeatedly press ``DEL`` key to enter BIOS configuration menu.
* In BIOS, navigate to menu
	* ``Boot``
		* Set ``Boot Option #1`` to ``UEFI OS (drive_name)``
		* Set ``Boot Option #2`` and all next ``Boot Option #`` to ``Disabled``
	* ``Save and Exit``
		* Hit ``Save Changes``
		* Hit ``Save Changes and Reset``
* Computer should boot ``Clover`` and show ``Clover Boot Menu``.
* If you have same Razer Blade Model trackpad, battery status, audio should become available.


If you have the same Razer Blade model, you are safe to jump to step **iCloud. iMessages and FaceTime**. Otherwise, you need to generate custom ACPI hot patches and USB mapping specific to your Razer Blade model.


### Disable Hibernation

Hibernation does not work correctly with the majority of hackintosh notebooks anyway.

* Run ``Terminal`` application from ``/Applications/Utilities/`` folder.
* To disable ``hibernation`` type and execute this command in ``Terminal`` application window

```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
```

* To remove ``hibernation`` ``sleepimage`` type and execute this command in ``Terminal`` application window

```
sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage
```

* To prevent create ``hibernation`` ``sleepimage`` in future type and execute this command in ``Terminal`` application window

```
sudo mkdir /var/vm/sleepimage
```

### Tweak Energy Saver

* Open ``System Preferences``.
* Click ``Energy Saver``.
* Click tab ``Power Adapter``.

![System_Preferences](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/System_Preferences.png)

* Disable ``Wake for Wi-Fi network access``.
* Disable ``Enable Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter``.

![System_Preferences_Energy_Saver](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/System_Preferences_Energy_Saver.png)


### ACPI patching

If you have a little bit different version of Razer Blade (just like mid 2019 Model OR Base Model OR different version of BIOS) the ACPI and USB patches will not be compatible with you Razer Blade!

In this case, ACPI hot patches should be created from scratch.

Again, it is very important to apply all BIOS patches, firmware updates before this step (!).


**ACPI export**

* Reboot computer.
* In ``Clover Boot Menu`` press ``F2`` and ``F4``.
* Repeat again with ``fn``+``F2`` and ``fn``+``F4``.
* Select normal macOS boot.


**DSDT patching for battery, trackpad**

* Login with the user with admin privileges: usually the first one created during installation procedure.
* Run ``Clover Configurator`` and mount NVMe ``EFI`` partition.
* Navigate to folder ``/Volumes/EFI/EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/``.
* Copy folder ``origin`` to ``Desktop`` folder.
* Copy ``MaciASL`` from the macOS USB installation media or re-download from Internet to ``~/Applications/`` folder.
* Copy ``iasl`` from the macOS USB installation media or re-download from Internet to.
* Unpack ``iasl.zip`` if required.
* Run ``Terminal`` application from ``/Applications/Utilities/`` folder.
* Copy ``iasl`` from ``~/Downloads/`` folder to ``/usr/local/bin/`` folder with command in ``Terminal`` application

```
sudo cp ~/Downloads/iasl /usr/local/bin/
```

* Navigate to ``~/Desktop/origin/`` folder in ``Terminal`` application with command ``cd ~/Desktop/origin/``.
* Disassembling ``.aml`` files with command in ``Terminal`` application

```
/usr/local/bin/iasl -da -dl DSDT.aml SSDT*.aml
```

* Run ``MaciASL`` application and open file ``~/Desktop/origin/DSDT.dsl``.
* Click ``Patch`` button in ``toolbar``.
* In ``Patch`` window on left panel scroll and find ``[bat] Razer Blade (2014)`` and click ``Apply``. Do not close window!

![DSDT_01_BAT](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_01_BAT.png)

* In ``Patch`` window on the left panel, scroll and find ``[gfx0] Disable/Enable on _WAK/_PTS (DSDT)`` and click ``Apply``. Do not close the window!

![DSDT_05_GFX](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_05_GFX.png)

* Click ``Close`` in ``Patch`` window.
* Click ``Compile`` button in ``toolbar``. ``DSDT`` should be compiled without any issues.
* Do not close this window.

Next step is hot patch DSDT for brightness settings between reboots.

* Hit ``Command+F`` for ``Search`` and search for device ``Device (ALSD)``. It should look like this:

```
    Device (ALSD)
    {
        Name (_HID, "ACPI0008")  // _HID: Hardware ID
        Method (_STA, 0, NotSerialized)  // _STA: Status
        {
            If (LEqual (ALSE, 0x02))
            {
                Return (0x0B)
            }

            Return (Zero)
        }

        Method (_ALI, 0, NotSerialized)  // _ALI: Ambient Light Illuminance
        {
            Return (Or (ShiftLeft (LHIH, 0x08), LLOW))
        }

        Name (_ALR, Package (0x05)  // _ALR: Ambient Light Response
        {
            Package (0x02)
            {
                0x46, 
                Zero
            }, 

            Package (0x02)
            {
                0x49, 
                0x0A
            }, 

            Package (0x02)
            {
                0x55, 
                0x50
            }, 

            Package (0x02)
            {
                0x64, 
                0x012C
            }, 

            Package (0x02)
            {
                0x96, 
                0x03E8
            }
        })
    }
```

![DSDT_ALS0_01](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_ALS0_01.png)

* And replace this device ``Device (ALSD)`` description with:

```
    Device (_SB.ALS0)
    {
        Name (_HID, "ACPI0008")  // _HID: Hardware ID
        Name (_CID, "smc-als")  // _STA: Status
        Name (_ALI, 300)  // _ALI: Ambient Light Illuminance
        Name (_ALR, Package ()  // _ALR: Ambient Light Response
        {
            Package () { 100, 300 },
        })
    }
```

![DSDT_ALS0_02](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_ALS0_02.png)

Next step is hot patch DSDT for trackpad.

* Mount ``IORegistryExplorer.dmg`` from folder ``Tools``.
* Right click on ``IORegistryExplorer.app`` application icon.

![IORegistryExplorer_Open_Right_Click](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/IORegistryExplorer_Open_Right_Click.png)

* Open ``IORegistryExplorer.app`` application with ``Open`` option in right click menu.
* Thera are possibility macOS will ask for admin password.
* Search for ``TPD0``. It can be very different for different computer but for Razer Blade notebooks is ``TPD0``.

![IORegistryExplorer_TPD0](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/IORegistryExplorer_TPD0.png)

* Open IOInterruptSpecifiers.
* Write down the first two numbers from the ``Value`` column as ``0xXX`` (In this case for Razer Blade Advanced early 2019 ``APIC`` pin number is ``0x5a``. This ``APIC`` pin number will be required during ``Trackpad GPIO Pinning`` procedure.
* Switch back to ``MaciASL`` application with opened file ``~/Desktop/origin/DSDT.dsl``.
* Hit ``Command+F`` for ``Search`` and search for method ``SSCN`` in scope ``Scope (_SB.PCI0.I2C0)`` lines like below.

```
Method (SSCN, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    Return (PKG3 (SSH0, SSL0, SSD0))
}

Method (FMCN, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    Return (PKG3 (FMH0, FML0, FMD0))
}
```

* Copy this block
* Rename this methods to something like this:

```
Method (_SCN, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    Return (PKG3 (SSH0, SSL0, SSD0))
}

Method (_MCN, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    Return (PKG3 (FMH0, FML0, FMD0))
}
```

![DSDT_11_SSCN_FMCN](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_11_SSCN_FMCN.png)

* Find a code like this:

```
Scope (_SB.PCI0.I2C0)
    {
        Name (I2CN, Zero)
        Name (I2CX, Zero)
        Method (_INI, 0, NotSerialized)  // _INI: Initialize
        {
            Store (SDS0, I2CN)
            Store (Zero, I2CX)
        }
        
        Device (TPD0)
```

* Above line ``Device (TPD0)`` paste the previously copied code. The result should look like this:

```
Scope (_SB.PCI0.I2C0)
    {
        Name (I2CN, Zero)
        Name (I2CX, Zero)
        Method (_INI, 0, NotSerialized)  // _INI: Initialize
        {
            Store (SDS0, I2CN)
            Store (Zero, I2CX)
        }

        Method (SSCN, 0, NotSerialized)
        {
            Return (PKG3 (SSH0, SSL0, SSD0))
        }

        Method (FMCN, 0, NotSerialized)
        {
            Return (PKG3 (FMH0, FML0, FMD0))
        }

![DSDT_12_SSCN_FMCN](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_12_SSCN_FMCN.png)

* Scroll down to method ``_CRS`` for scope ``_SB.PCI0.I2C0``. It should look like this:

```
Method (_CRS, 0, NotSerialized)  // _CRS: Current Resource Settings
{
    If (LLess (OSYS, 0x07DC))
    {
        Return (SBFI)
    }

    If (LEqual (TPDM, Zero))
    {
        Return (ConcatenateResTemplate (I2CM (I2CX, BADR, SPED), SBFG))
    }

    Return (ConcatenateResTemplate (I2CM (I2CX, BADR, SPED), SBFI))
}
```

* And replace with:

```
Method (_CRS, 0, NotSerialized)  // _CRS: Current Resource Settings
{
    Return (ConcatenateResTemplate (I2CM (I2CX, BADR, SPED), SBFG))
}
```

![DSDT_13__CRS](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_13__CRS.png)

* Click ``Compile`` button in ``toolbar``. ``DSDT`` should be complied without any issues.
* Choose ``Save`` from ``File`` menu.
* Choose ``Save As…`` from ``File`` menu.
* Down below in ``Save`` window select ``ACPI Machine Language Binary`` from ``File Format:`` menu.
* Save this file as ``DSDT.aml``. ``MaciASL`` application will recommend the file name automatically.

![DSDT_Save_As_2](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_Save_As_2.png)

* Copy the newly created file ``DSDT.aml`` to ``/Volumes/EFI/EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/``
* Restart computer. After restart you will get working trackpad in ``Polling Mode``.


**(Optional) Trackpad GPIO Pinning**

This step is optional but highly recommended.

Before you begin make sure you computer's Platform Controller Hub is Cannon Point-H (Coffee Lake CPU). For other platforms tables will be different. In this case please check with [GPIO Pinning](https://voodooi2c.github.io/#GPIO%20Pinning/GPIO%20Pinning) documentation.

* Check with ``APIC`` pin number saved in previous procedure (In this case for Razer Blade Advanced early 2019 ``APIC`` pin number is ``0x5a``.
* Write down the label of form ``GPP_XYY_IRQ`` by searching up the ``APIC`` pin number on [Cannon Point-H Labels](https://github.com/coreboot/coreboot/blob/master/src/soc/intel/cannonlake/include/soc/gpio_defs_cnp_h.h#L42). For ``0x5a`` it will be ``GPP_C18_IRQ``.

![DSDT_GPIO_Pin_01](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_GPIO_Pin_01.png)

* Write down the decimal ``GPIO`` pin number by searching the label on [Cannon Point-H Decimal Pin Numbers](https://github.com/coreboot/coreboot/blob/master/src/soc/intel/cannonlake/include/soc/gpio_soc_defs_cnp_h.h#L40). For ``GPP_C18`` it will be ``69``.

![DSDT_GPIO_Pin_02](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_GPIO_Pin_02.png)

* Write down the ``CHIPSET_GPP`` by searching the label ``GPP_X`` on [Cannon Point-H Chipset GPP](https://github.com/coolstar/VoodooGPIO/blob/master/VoodooGPIO/CannonLake-H/VoodooGPIOCannonLakeH.hpp#L414). For ``GPP_C18`` label will be ``GPP_C`` and ``CHIPSET_GPP`` will be:

```
CNL_GPP(0, 51, 74, 64),             /* GPP_C */
```

![DSDT_GPIO_Pin_03](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_GPIO_Pin_03.png)

* ``Chipset_GPP`` format is ``CHIPSET_GPP(num, base, end, gpio_base)``
* Calculate a usable GPIO pin by taking the ``decimal pin number - base + gpio_base``.
* For Razer Blade Advanced early 2019 is:

```
69-51+64 = 82
```

* Use [Decimal to Hexadecimal Converter](https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/decimal-to-hex-converter) to convert decimal to hexadecimal. In this case it will be ``52``.

![DSDT_GPIO_Pin_10_Decimal_to_Hexadecimal_Converter](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_GPIO_Pin_10_Decimal_to_Hexadecimal_Converter.png)

* Now find something that looks like this under ``Device (TPD0)``

```
Name (SBFG, ResourceTemplate ()
{
GpioInt (Level, ActiveLow, ExclusiveAndWake, PullDefault, 0x0000,
    "\\_SB.PCI0.GPI0", 0x00, ResourceConsumer, ,
    )
    {   // Pin list
	0x0000
    }
})
```

* And replace the pin with the calculated GPIO pin XX. In this case it will be ``52``.

```
Name (SBFG, ResourceTemplate ()
{
GpioInt (Level, ActiveLow, ExclusiveAndWake, PullDefault, 0x0000,
    "\\_SB.PCI0.GPI0", 0x00, ResourceConsumer, ,
    )
    {   // Pin list
	0x52
    }
})
```

![DSDT_GPIO_Pin_11](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_GPIO_Pin_11.png)


* Find the method ``_CRS`` from before and change to

```
Method (_CRS, 0, NotSerialized) // _CRS: Current Resource Settings
{
    Return (ConcatenateResTemplate(SBFB, SBFG))
}
```

![DSDT_GPIO_Pin_05__CRS](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_GPIO_Pin_05__CRS.png)

* Click ``Compile`` button in ``toolbar``. ``DSDT`` should be complied without any issues.
* Choose ``Save`` from ``File`` menu.
* Choose ``Save As…`` from ``File`` menu.
* Down below in ``Save`` window select ``ACPI Machine Language Binary`` from ``File Format:`` menu.
* Save this file as ``DSDT.aml``. ``MaciASL`` application will recommend the file name automatically.

![DSDT_Save_As_2](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/DSDT_Save_As_2.png)

* Copy the newly created file ``DSDT.aml`` to ``/Volumes/EFI/EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/``

Next step is hot patch ACPI to disable Nvidia GPU in macOS for saving battery and decreasing the overall heat.


**Nvidia GPU disable**

* Open ``SSDT-12-OptTabl.dsl`` with ``MaciASL`` application.
* Find this header:

```
\_SB.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP and expand it, click on _OFF
```

* Find this line of code:

```
Method (_OFF, 0, Serialized) // _OFF: Power Off
```

![SSDT-12-OptTabl_01](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/SSDT-12-OptTabl_01.png)

* Above the code, paste this line of code:

```
Method (_INI) {_OFF() } // added to call _OFF
```

![SSDT-12-OptTabl_02](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/SSDT-12-OptTabl_02.png)

* Once that is pasted in, click on the ``Patch`` button in ``toolbar`` and copy and paste this code into the ``Patch`` window:

```

* Write down the USB port identifications for the internal USB devices. This information will be required later to properly setup the USB type to properly enable a sleep mode. For RBA early 2019, it will be like this:
	* HS05 - Controller XHC - Bluetooth
	* HS07 - Controller XHC - Integrated Camera
	* HS08 - Controller XHC - Razer Blade
* You will need to mark these ports like ``255`` later.
* Detect properly ``USB 2.0`` ports.
	* Insert in every ``USB-A`` port for 15-20sec and detach ``USB 2.0`` (!) device. Command will highlight the newly detected ports with colour.
	* Write down the ports number.
* Detect properly ``USB 3.0`` ports.
	* Insert in every ``USB-A`` port for 15-20sec and detach ``USB 3.0 or 3.1`` (!) device. Command will highlight the newly detected ports with colour.
	* Write down the ports number.
* Detect properly ``USB-C`` ports.
	* Insert ``USB-C`` device into ``USB-C`` port for 15-20sec and detach. Command will highlight the newly detected ports with colour.
	* Write down the ports number.
	* Insert ``USB-A 2.0`` device into ``USB-C`` port with ``USB-A to USB-C`` cable for 15-20sec and detach. Command will highlight the newly detected ports with colour.
	* Write down the ports number.
* When ports are detected, press ``Q`` to go back to the ``Main`` screen.
* In the ``Main`` screen, press ``P`` to open ``Edit Plist & Create SSDT/Kext`` screen.
* All ports will be automatically marked like ``Type 3`` ports.
* Mark internal ports like ``Type 255``. This is very important to enable a sleep mode. Without this computer will wake up every 20-40secs even with the lid closed.
* Here, there are tips how to do this:

```
Select ports to toggle with comma-delimited lists (eg. 1,2,3,4,5)
Change types using this formula T:1,2,3,4,5:t where t is the type
Set custom names using this formula C:1:Name - Name = None to clear
```

* You can do this with a command. For example:

```
T:4,6,7:255
```

* Next you need to mark properly ``Type`` for ``USB-C``.
	* In my case ``SS03`` is ``Type 9``.
	* And ``SS03`` is ``USB 2.0`` ``Type 8``.
* Next is to build and install ``USBMap.kext``.
* Press ``K`` to execute ``Build USBMap.kext``.

Undervolting
---

There are several tools for Windows for undervolting and overclocking CPU and GPU. Just like:

* [Intel Extreme Tuning Utility](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24075/Intel-Extreme-Tuning-Utility-Intel-XTU-)
* [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/page/afterburner)
* [ThrottleStop](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/)

With macOS, it is a different story. There are a few tools for macOS for undervolting, but they require additional macOS Extensions (kext's). Often, they are not free or not very well supported.

* [VoltageShift](https://github.com/sicreative/VoltageShift)

So, I decided to go Rogue and do undervolt with BIOS. Tools like ``XTU`` provide better control, but I need a solution that will work both in Windows and Debian Linux and macOS.

AMI BIOS provides a lot of different tools for undervolting and overclocking.

The most interesting and easy to use are:

* ``Processor``
	* ``Core Voltage Offset``
* ``GT``
	* ``GT Voltage Offset``
	* ``GTU Voltage Offset``
* ``Uncore``
	* ``Uncore Voltage Offset``

To apply configuration:

* Reboot computer.
* Repeatedly press ``DEL`` key to enter BIOS configuration menu.
* In BIOS navigate to menu
	* ``Advanced``
		* ``Processor``
			* Set ``Core Voltage Offset`` to 100.
			* Set ``Offset Prefix`` to ``-`` (!).
		* ``GT``
			* Set ``GT Voltage Offset`` to 100.
			* Set ``Offset Prefix`` to ``-`` (!).
			* Set ``GTU Voltage Offset`` to 100.
			* Set ``Offset Prefix`` to ``-`` (!).
		* ``Uncore``
			* Set ``Uncore Voltage Offset`` to 60.
			* Set ``Offset Prefix`` to ``-`` (!).
		* ``Memory``
			* Set ``Memory Profile`` to the best for installed memory. Usually something like ``XMP profile 1``. 
	* ``Save and Exit``
		* Hit ``Save Changes``
		* Hit ``Save Changes and Reset``
* Boot in macOS or Windows.
* Download [Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) application.
* Run ``Torture Test...`` from ``Options`` menu for at least 1h.
* If the system works stably, repeat all the steps and incremental increase undervolting for -5. It is better to keep undervolting for ``Processor`` and ``GT/GTU`` on the same level. Repeat again ``Torture Test...``. If the system is unstable under ``Torture Test...``, freezes or reboots, revert back to the previous working configuration.

| Option | Configuration start undervolting | Recommended step | My stable working configuration |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ``Processor Core Voltage Offset`` | -100 | -5 | -140 |
| ``GT Core Voltage Offset`` | -100 | -5 | -140 |
| ``GTU Core Voltage Offset`` | -100 | -5 | -140 |
| ``Uncore Voltage Offset`` | -60 | -5 | -120 |

CPU limitations can be very different even in same series. So, do not use my configuration blindly.

BIOS has many additional configurations for undervolting and overclocking, just like TDP (Thermal Design Power), but this requires extensive knowledge in CPU/Chipset/etc. and power management. This is not a part of this documentation. For more information, check the links provided at the end of the document.

**Note: It looks like the mid 2019 Razer Blade Advanced has been undervolted from factory! But there are still room for improvement.**

Nvidia BIOS flashing
---

Razer Blade Advanced mid 2019 has very few changes in comparison to the previous early 2019 model.

* Better screen refresh rate.
* Can be packed with i7 9750H CPU for extra money.

The biggest disadvantage is 80w 2080 Max-Q instead of 90w in the previous model. This is a huge difference for general performance. Check article [Comparison: 80w vs 90w RTX 2080 Max-Q](https://www.theeverydayenthusiast.com/home/comparison-80w-vs-90w-2080-max-q).

* Reboot computer.
* Select Windows 10 partition in ``Clover``.
* Download this repository ZIP archive.
* Unpack archive.
* Backup Nvidia BIOS with ``GPU-Z`` application from ``Tools\Nvidia\`` repository folder (!).
* Open ``cmd.exe`` with admin privileges.
* In ``cmd.exe`` window change folder to ``BIOS_mod\Nvidia_2080_Max-Q_BIOS_mod\`` repository folder.
* To apply 90w TDP type in ``cmd.exe`` window command

```
nvflash64.exe -6 Nvidia_2080_Max-Q_90w.rom
```

* And press ``Enter``.
* Press ``Y`` for the warning(s).
* Reboot computer.

Razer Chroma
---

Razer Chroma support for Razer Blade notebooks and the latest Razer devices has not been implemented for macOS yet. I suppose, it will never be implemented.

Thanks to [osx-razer-blade](https://github.com/boo-dev/osx-razer-blade) project, I've already had enough information, so I am working on cli tool to control Razer Blade keyboard and logo Chroma lighting.


Windows

### NVMe partition

* Open ``Disk Utility``
* Select ``Show All Devices`` from ``View`` menu.
* Select the NVMe drive on left pane.
* Click ``Partition`` button at the top toolbar.
* Click continue with partition.
* Add a new partition by clicking the ``[+]`` button under the circle.
* Give it a name and desired size (minimum 50Gb required for Windows 10).

* Click ``Apply``.


### Windows installation media preparation

* Download Windows 10 ISO image.
* Open [Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File) URL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO) in Safari. It better to download ISO image on macOS. Microsoft detects OS and prevent download ISO image on Windows machine. It can be override by browser ``User-Agent`` replacement but still easier todo this on macOS.
* From ``Select Edition`` menu select ``Windows 10 May 2019 Update`` (!). ``Windows 10 October 2019 Update`` ISO image have issues Microsoft still have not fixed.

![Windows_Download1](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/Windows_Download1.png)

### Windows installation

* Insert Windows 10 USB installation media.
* Reboot the computer.
* Press repeatedly ``F12`` until you ``Boot Menu`` will show.
* Select the USB installation media with Windows 10.
* Follow the usual Windows 10 installation procedure.

### Clover Boot fix

To fix dual-booting hackintosh, rename bootmgfw.efi to bootmgfw-orig.efi causing Clover to become unblocked. Add the tag ``-orig`` to the name so that it’s still a recognizable file and is shown in the Windows EFI partition for booting in the ``Clover Boot`` loader menu.

To rename ``bootmgfw.efi``

* Boot off macOS installation media.
* Boot macOS.
* Open ``Clover Configurator`` application.
* Select ``Mount EFI`` on the left column.
* Click ``Mount Partition`` for the drive where macOS and Windows is installed on.
* Click ``Open Partition``.
* Navigate to ``EFI/Microsoft/Boot/``.
* Rename ``bootmgfw.efi`` to ``bootmgfw-orig.efi``.
* Restart.
* UEFI OS (drive_name) should be an available boot device.


#### (Optional) Override Windows Boot Manager

If for some reason the UEFI OS (drive_name) isn’t shown as an available boot device, there is a way to override ``Windows Boot Manager`` and have it redirected to ``Clover``.

* Boot off macOS installation media.
* Boot macOS.
* Open ``Clover Configurator`` application.
* Select ``Mount EFI`` on left column.
* Click ``Mount Partition`` for the drive where macOS and Windows is installed on.
* Click ``Open Partition``.
* Open the ``EFI`` partition and navigate to ``EFI/BOOT/``
* Copy ``BOOTX64.efi``.
* Navigate to ``EFI/Windows/Boot``.
* Paste ``BOOTX64.efi``.
* Rename ``BOOTX64.efi`` to ``bootmgfw.efi``.
* Restart.
* Now ``Windows Boot Manager`` will redirects to ``Clover`` instead of booting Windows.

**Note: Very often, with cumulative and security updates Windows 10 will place new ``bootmgfw.efi`` in ``EFI/Microsoft/Boot/``. You can notice this by two Windows boot options in ``Clover`` boot screen. Just remove old ``bootmgfw-orig.efi`` and rename new ``bootmgfw.efi`` to  ``bootmgfw-orig.efi``.**

Known Issues and Limitations
---

**Limitations**

* Nvidia Web Drivers are not available for macOS 10.14 Mojave. Nvidia does not want to implement support for Apple 2D/3D rendering framework Metal and does not want to share access for Nvidia drivers source code for Apple. So, currently no support for Nvidia GPU for macOS 10.14 Mojave is available. It's not a problem for me because I'm using Windows 10 partition for gaming and Debian Linux partition to run the ML tasks overnight.
	* HDMI and DisplayPort ports both are connected directly to Nvidia GPU and will not work in macOS 10.14 Mojave.
	* USB-C to HDMI should work without any issues.

![HDMI_DP](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh/raw/master/images/HDMI_DP.png)

* Windows Hello camera is not supported in macOS.
* Not all sensors are supported by VirtualSMC.


**Issues**

* Sometimes, the screen does not wake up when you open the lid after the computer was in a sleep mode. You need to close and open the lid again. This issue has appeared after the latest BIOS update. Although annoying, it is not that important.


Conclusion
---

It's a pretty good laptop with a way better keyboard than 2016-2019y MacBook Pro. It is a solid workstation and an extremely good gaming machine. It has easy to upgrade NVMe and RAM and WiFi modules. This Model supports NVMe up to 2Tb and RAM up to 64Gb.

Major disadvantages are:

* PC trackpads still cannot match with MacBook Pro. This one is good. It is much better than most PC notebooks have, but still not even close to MacBook Pro.
* The screen is rather mediocre in comparison to MacBook Pro. 144Hz is good for gaming. If you are working with text a lot just like me, maybe, it will be better to get 4K panel. For content creators, it is mandatory to get the 4K panel.

P.S. Apple, please fix the keyboard and release a real Pro MacBook. Just take a look on Razer Blade Advanced as that is a good place for starting to design a new MacBook Pro.
